##Network: Directed graph (questioners and answerers)
* Nodes: users

* Weights: the frequency of answering questions (number of answers over time)

##Possible quesiotns
1.  bow tie structure(like web graph): percentage of people in in-group, out-group, core, tendril and tube? Is it balanced?
2.  Distribution of in-degree and out-degree. Is it balanced? 
3.  What's the characteristic of people with different degrees of knowledge? e.g. expertise often answer questions for newbies? Or expertise? Assortativity?
